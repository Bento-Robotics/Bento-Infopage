        <section class="bento-section big"><font size="5">About Us</font><font size="4">WLS robotics formed in early 2021, as Prof. Dr. Stefan May of the OHM university stumbled across an extracurricular technology course offered by our school, the WLS, and decided to lend support and introduce the world of robotics.<br><br>We lay focus on creating simple and easy-to-maintain educational robots using ROS, micro-ROS, EduArt's drive system and off-the-shelf electronics, with the goal of acquiring and passing on the skills and knowledge required to work on mobile platforms, be it mechanics, electronics, software or just plain old troubleshooting.</font></section>

        <section class="bento-section"><font size="2">This is Zyklop, our initial robot. It was our first real experience with ROS and professional robotics.<br><br>Zyklop is great at navigating rough terrain but has a deficit of sensors.</font></section>
        <section class="bento-section"><font size="2">Bento-Box was the second addition to our robot family. It was be used at the Robocup in Bordeaux.<br><br>We chose the name mostly so that we can call it the bento \'Box\', but also because we presume it\'ll end up looking like a box, since this happened with Zyklop.</font></section>
        <section class="bento-section"><font size="2">Bento-Box really struggles at climbing ledges and stairs. As EduArt offered us new hardware, we decided to try out a flipper-based robot, naming it Schäufele.<br><br>We are still learning how to make articulated tracks behave nicely, so Schäufele can be difficult at times.</font></section>
